## CLASSIFICATION 
Classification is a Supervised Machine Learning technique. That means we train on data w/ answers/labels

- We train with ansers/labels to produce a decision rule we'll use to classify future data.


- For Classification algorithms, you determine the probability of an observation to be part of a certain class or not. Therefore, you express the probability with a value between 0 and 1. A probability close to 1 means the observation is very likely to be part of a group or category.
